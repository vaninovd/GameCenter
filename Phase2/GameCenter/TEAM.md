For group team communication we will use Slack.


Each team member agrees to do the following:

- I will get my allotted work done on time.
- I will attend every team meeting and actively participate.
- Should an emergency arise that prevents me from attending a team meeting, I will notify my team immediately.
- The work will be divided roughly equally among all team members.
- I will help my team to understand every concept in the project.
- If I do not understand a concept or code, I will immediately ask my team for help.


We will work individually, each on one feature of the game. After our individual work is done, we
will split into pairs/groups of three to combine the features. 
The following is the breakdown of individual work:


Pavel - Undo functionality.
Nikita - GameCenter functionality.
Winnie - ScoreBoard functionality.
Jamal - AutoSave functionality.
Dennis - Different Board sizes.

If a member finishes their part, he/she helps another member finish theirs.
