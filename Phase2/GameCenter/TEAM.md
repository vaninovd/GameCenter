For group team communication we will use Slack.


Each team member agrees to do the following:

- I will get my allotted work done on time.
- I will attend every team meeting and actively participate.
- Should an emergency arise that prevents me from attending a team meeting, I will notify my team immediately.
- The work will be divided roughly equally among all team members.
- I will help my team to understand every concept in the project.
- If I do not understand a concept or code, I will immediately ask my team for help.

We will work in pairs on eah of the games, except Dennis, who will create unit tests for Sliding Tiles 
as well as fix the sliding tiles unsolvability issue and help prepare tiles for each of the two new games.

The following is the breakdown of individual work:

Pavel and Jamal - Flip Card game and corresponding unit tests.
Nikita and Winnie - 2048 Game and corresponding unit tests.
Dennis - Imagery for two new games, Sliding Tiles unit tests, unsolvability issue in Sliding Tiles. 

If a member finishes their part, he/she helps another member finish theirs.
